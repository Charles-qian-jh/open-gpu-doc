     This manual describes the USERMODE device.  USERMODE is a mappable range of
registers for use by usermode drivers.  The range is 64KB aligned and 64KB in
size to match the maximum page size of systems supported by NVIDIA hardware.

     Note that accesses to undefined registers in this device range do not cause
PRI_TIMEOUT interrupts to be raised.  This is different from other PRI devices.
Writes to undefined registers are silently thrown away.  Reads from undefined
registers return 0.

2  -  IDENTIFICATION AND CAPABILITIES REGISTERS
===============================================================================

     The first 128 bytes of the NV_USERMODE device are reserved for up to 32
configuration and capabilities registers.


CFG0 - Config register 0: Class ID for the NV_USERMODE class

     The USERMODE_CLASS_ID field of the CFG0 register contains the class ID for
the class corresponding to the NV_USERMODE device.  In gv100, this is the class
volta_usermode_a.


#define  NV_USERMODE_CFG0                                 0x00810000 /* R--4R */
#define  NV_USERMODE_CFG0_USERMODE_CLASS_ID                     15:0 /* R-IUF */
#define  NV_USERMODE_CFG0_USERMODE_CLASS_ID_VALUE             50017 /* R-I-V */

// Note: addresses up to 0x810080 are reserved for CGF and capabilities registers


3  -  PTIMER CURRENT TIME REGISTERS
===============================================================================

     The TIME registers contain the current time as kept by the PTIMER; see
dev_timer.ref.  The current time is expressed in elapsed nanoseconds since the
UNIX epoch, 00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970 (zero hour).  It generally has a
resolution of 32 nanoseconds.

     Note: To query the current time, read TIME_1, then TIME_0, and then TIME_1
again.  If the two readings of TIME_1 do not match, repeat the procedure.  This
avoids incorrectly retrieving an incorrect time referring to a point up to 4
seconds in the future: if one were to simply read TIME_0 and then TIME_1, TIME_0
may overflow between the two reads.

     TIME_0 contains the low 32 bits of the timer. The least significant 5 bits
are always zero.  The NSEC field contains the low order bits in 32ns
granularity.

     TIME_1 contains the high order bits.  The NSEC field contains the upper 29
bits of the timer.


TIME_0 Register - Timer Low Bits


#define NV_USERMODE_TIME_0                                0x00810080 /* R--4R */
#define NV_USERMODE_TIME_0_NSEC                                 31:5 /* R-XUF */


TIME_1 Register - Timer High Bits


#define NV_USERMODE_TIME_1                                0x00810084 /* R--4R */
#define NV_USERMODE_TIME_1_NSEC                                 28:0 /* R-XUF */

// Note: addresses 0x810088 and 0x81008c are reserved for future TIME registers



4  -  CHANNEL WORK SUBMISSION REGISTERS
===============================================================================

NOTIFY_CHANNEL_PENDING - Notify Host that a channel has new work available

     Writing a channel ID to the ID field of NOTIFY_CHANNEL_PENDING tells Host
that new work is available to run on that channel.  This causes the PENDING
status to be set in the NV_PCCSR_CHANNEL_STATUS field for that channel and
behaves identically to writing NV_PCCSR_CHANNEL_FORCE_PENDING, but is accessible
to usermode drivers.  Setting pending will cause Host to schedule the channel
the next time it comes up in the runlist.  Once the channel is scheduled, the
PBDMA will read GP_PUT from USERD to determine whether work is actually
available for the channel.

     Submitting new work to a channel involves these steps:

     1. Write methods to the pushbuffer space
     2. Construct a new gp_fifo entry pointing to that pushbuffer space
     3. Update GP_PUT in USERD to indicate the new gp_fifo entry is ready
     4. Write the channel's handle to NV_USERMODE_NOTIFY_CHANNEL_PENDING_ID

     Note that if the ID refers to a non-existent channel, the write will be
ignored.  Moreover, a write to an ID that exceeds the maximum supported channel
ID will have no effect (it will not overflow, causing some other channel to go
pending).

     Note that if the ID refers to a channel for which GP_PUT == GP_GET, Host will
still schedule the channel in order to determine the current status of its
GP_PUT, at which point it will discover there is no new work and move on to the
next channel.


#define  NV_USERMODE_NOTIFY_CHANNEL_PENDING               0x00810090 /* -W-4R */
#define  NV_USERMODE_NOTIFY_CHANNEL_PENDING_ID                  31:0 /* -W-UF */
